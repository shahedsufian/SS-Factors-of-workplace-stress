# Factors associated with workplace stress: A mixed-method study among white-collar employees of pharmaceutical industries in Bangladesh
**Shahed Md Abu Sufian, MPH**
## Abstract
This study explores socio-demographic and occupational risk factors associated with workplace stress and its reasons related to the nature of job among white-collar employees working in the pharmaceutical industry in Bangladesh. The study was conducted on 481 white-collar employees of eleven pharmaceutical companies in Bangladesh and incorporated a mixed-method approach. Among the study population, 85.24% feel moderate and high WS. Each job department, work experience in the current company, and work hours have statistically significant associations with workplace stress. Female employees find unreasonable group and political pressures more stressful, whereas male employees feel that responsibility for persons is more stress-inducive. Qualitative exploration reveals that work-family conflict and stereotyping cause workplace stress among female employees. Responsibility for persons seems more stressful to higher managerial levels compared to the lower-level employees to whom under-participation and financial constraints feel more stressful. Findings suggest developing policies for ensuring equal opportunity for females, standard work hours, and a mentally healthy workplace.
